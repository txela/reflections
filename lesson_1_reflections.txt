How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
	Being able to compare the two version is a lot more easier than going through code line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
	Refer and pin point which methods and ways are more effective in certain tasks
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	  Manually choosing after logical milestones
	  Automatically is good only for word processing and less for coding since it may 
	not be logical if it is automatically save inbetween lines of code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in 
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Since some programs require files to refer to one another. It is better if it was all saved together in a repository.
	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log displays all entries
	git diff displays all differences between the two entries
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	If I break something I can always just restore it!
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	I want to create a version control for all my upcoming projects to have better exploration options.
